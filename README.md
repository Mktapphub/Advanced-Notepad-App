# Product Description
Advanced Notepad¬Æ features two basic note-taking formats: a normal blank-styled text option and a to-do list option. Add as many notes as you want to your Notepad, which appears on the app's home screen each time the program opens.

# - Taking a Note -
Serving as a simple word processing program, the text option allows for as many characters as you're willing to type. Once saved, you can edit, share, or delete the notes.

# - Making a To-Do List or Shopping List -
In the Daily Planner mode, you can add as many items as you'd like and save them according to the date.
